# Qix-Game

This is a project I completed in collaboration with 4 others. The goal is to recreate a version of Atari's Qix game.
In this repository you'll find the design documentation, the source code, gameplay footage, and the executable.

The executable, by default, gets blocked by antivirus. Please download and view the gameplay footage to see the final product.
